In SQL queries, two common closures are id=('$id') and id=("$id"), such as
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=('$id') LIMIT 0,1
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=("$id") LIMIT 0,1
This closure mode is easy to be attacked in the following ways:
?id=1'
?id=1') --+
?id=1') and 1=1 --+
?id=1') and 1=0 --+

To try it, follow these steps:
\1. Visit the URL http://43.136.237.143:40032/ and set it to url. Look at the page source and analyze the meaning of the code given by the page.
\2. When you need the value of the parameter to be the same as the given string, you can use php's data or input pseudo-protocol to write, if you are not clear about the knowledge, go to the web page to find and concatenate the appropriate request.
\3. When you need to access the source code of a file that may have hints, you can use php's filter protocol to read the base64 converted source code, after read the code, write code that can access the flag file according to it.
You need to try to bypass the restrictions one by one, and finally, after all the restrictions have been bypassed, build a request that bypasses all the restrictions and reads the contents of the flag file.Remember, though, that you no longer need to use the filter protocol when you finally build the request.The final flag may appear in the source code of the page, so remember to check the source code of the page.
