    Tip:
    1. First pass a parameter to see if the command can be executed, such as /? c=19-1
    2. Then the blacklist filters a lot of things, the regular cat/flag can not be used, here is a knowledge point is that php can pass the function name through the string to a variable, and then through this variable dynamic call function such as the following code will execute system(' cat/flag ') : $a='system'; $a('cat/flag'); What is the parameter used here? c=($_GET[a])($_GET[b])&a=system&b=cat /flag
    3. However, _GET and a and b are not in the whitelist, so they need to be replaced. c=($_GET[pi])($_GET[abs])&pi=system&abs=cat /flag
    4. But _GET here can not be replaced directly, and [] is also filtered by the blacklist, here you need to understand the function in the whitelist he gave, here the _GET to convert the function, here the _GET is an ASCII character, the _GET is converted to hexadecimal first. The hexadecimal string is then converted to ASCII using the hex2bin() function, so hex2bin(5f 47 45 54) is _GET
    5. But the hex2bin() function is not in the whitelist, and 5f, 47, 45, 54 cannot be directly filled in. Here will be preg_match_all (' / [a - zA - Z_ \ x7f - \ XFF] [a zA - Z_0-9 \ x7f - \ XFF] * / ", $content, $used_funcs); To run a whitelist test.
    Here the hex2bin() function can be converted using the base_convert() function
    The base_convert() function can convert numbers between arbitrary bases
    Here, hex2bin can be viewed as base 36, and a base_convert converts a number from base 10 to base 16 to generate hex2bin
    Hex2bin = base_convert (37907361743,10,36)
    And then 5f, 47, 45, 54 is going to use the dechex() function to convert a decimal number into a hexadecimal number
    dechex(1598506324), 1598506324 converted to hexadecimal is 5f 47 45 54
