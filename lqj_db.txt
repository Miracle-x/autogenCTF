To try it, follow these steps:
1.Visit the URL http://43.136.237.143:40030/Less-5/ and set it to url. Look at the page source and search for the potential name of the submittable parameter and set it to para.
2.Visit url with para=1, para=1', and para=1" respectively, see which response contains an error, and set the corresponding request field to pre. Change the value of para and check whether the command output changes. If no, you can only consider error injection, Boolean injection, and time blind injection. Error injection is preferred.
3.If consider error injection,visit pre+'union select updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select@@version),0x7e),1); --+' to collect database version information.
4.Replace select@@version with another sql query, For example, concat(0x3a,(select(group_concat(table_name))from(information_schema.tables)where(table_schema=database()))), to collect table names.
5.After the table name is found, query the contents of all tables one by one.
You need to provide the process and results of each task.

To try it, follow these steps:
1.Visit the URL http://43.136.237.143:40012/ and set it to url. Look at the page source for the name of the submittable parameter and set it to para.
2.Visit url with para=1, para=1', and para=1" respectively, see which response contains an error, and set the corresponding request field to pre.
3.Access pre + 'order by 1 #' and increments the number after 'by' until the page feedback contains an Unknown column, then the last digit of this feedback is the maximum number of columns.
4.Access pre + 'union select 1' to increase the following number up to the maximum number of columns, and note if the page feedback appears to have a regular expression with filter characters, if it does and contains select, union, where, the feedback is that the error injection cannot be used. If not, the error injection is reported as usable.
5.If you can use error injection in the previous step, visit pre+'union select 1,group_concat(table_name) from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'database()' #' to query the table name, If the previous step was unusable error injection, use pre+'; show tables ; #' to query the table name, Look at the feedback of the web page and guess the string that might be the table name.
6.Access pre+'; handler table name open; handler table name read first; #', replace each potential table name with 'table name', if the table name is purely numeric, it needs to be wrapped in ``.if there is a page response containing flag{, the attack is successful, and select the content contained in the page response flag{}.
